        ## A magnet for opponents  
        The opponents feel like they are attracted to you like you are a magnet. Especially when you try to overtake them in the top 5.

        ## Jump start
        Like in Mario Kart you can get an extra speed boost at the start. You also have the ability to use nitro a few times a race. These are also scattered around the track as pickups.

        ## Fuel is your main problem
        For some races it’s your main problem will be to keep up your fuel level. You won’t be able to reach the finish line without doing so. Since the fuel is positioned in unfortunate spots it’s hard to keep ahead of the herd and also pick up fuel.

        ## The ugly duckling
        Sometimes the "ugly" cars are the better choice when it comes to statistics. More often than not I used the Fiat Uno - "Cable guy" car in the early stages because of the top speed and handling.

        ## Outrun (1999) successor
        The game really looks and feels like the great old school arcade racer Outrun but with updated graphics.
